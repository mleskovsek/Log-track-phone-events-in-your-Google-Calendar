This App doesn't have user interface, it runs in background.

Note 1: first after install you need to long tap on app icon and select app info, and there you should allow all permissions it requires and you can disable notifications as they are not used yet in these early versions and right now they are useless (just a placeholder kind of). Then you need to start app so it actually starts working. When the app starts the phone should say "App started" through its speakers (have your volume for media turned high to hear that).

Note 2: You need to manually launch this app each time phone restarts. You can kill the app, or remove any permissions by long clicking on app icon in android.

Note 3: To make this app launch automatically when phone turns on you can use some autostart app, we use this one mostly: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.autostart

Note 4: This app will write logs in a new Google Calendar that you need to create in your Gmail account and it should be named Logs. Just "Logs" exactly. It seems you need to be on a desktop browser to make this new calendar and it will take few minutes for android calendar to see this change (helps if you restart phone while waiting).

Note 5: The app does not log outgoing text messages due to Google's security restrictions.

Note 6: You need to have the right Calendar app installed in your phone for this app to work. On Samsung A40 for example, the native Samsung Calendar works great. On some other phones Google Calendar works great (please be aware that there are two almost identical Google Calendar apps, one is called simply "calendar" - that one should work I think). Many people have good experience also wizth OneCalendar app that you can also find in Google Play.
